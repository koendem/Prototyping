WebLogic
=============
1. Installing WebLogic.
  sudo mkdir -p /opt/wls
  cd /opt/wls
  sudo unzip /home/koen/shared/oracle/WebLogic/wls1213_devzip_update1.zip 
  cd /opt
  sudo chmod -R koen:koen wls
  cd /opt/wls/wls12130
  ## Note: make sure you have Java_home and mw_home set. For example:
  export MW_HOME=/opt/wls/wls12130
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_45
  ## But it is obviously better to have these added to the  /etc/profile   script.
  . ./configure.sh
  Note: you may answer 'n' to the question as to whether you want to create a new domain or not.
  
2. Setup WebLogic.
  ## We follow the instructions in the README.txt file which is inside the /opt/wls/wls12130 folder.
  . $MW_HOME/wlserver/server/bin/setWLSEnv.sh
  
3. Instead of following the README to set up a domain, we use the UI to do this.
  cd oracle_common/common/bin
  mkdir -p /opt/wls/domains/com.silvermoongroup
  ## now start the UI with the following command:
  ./config.sh
  ## in the UI : select the directory created above for the 'domain location' of the new domain you want to create
  ## Next step:  select the templates to be sued for creating the domain. Select the JAX-WS, JAX-RPC, JAX-WS SOAP/JMS Extension from [oracle_common]
  ## Add an Administration user.  We used : lunosadmin / lunos123@
  ## Note: I was unable to get through this process intially. It only worked for me when I created the user before starting the ./config.sh application  !!
  ## Under Advanced Configuration, we select the following options:
  ##   Administration Server,
  ##   Node Manager,
  ##   Managed Servers, Clusters and Coherence
  ##   Deployments and Services
  ## Next: 
  ##   give the following name for the Administration Server:   LunosAdministrationServer
  ## Next:
  ##   give the Node manager credentials : lunosadmin/lunos123@
  ## Next:
  ##   Add one managed server, give it the name: opa
  ## Do not add anything on clusters.
  ## Next: Add one machine, call it : local
  ## Next: assign both server (LunosAdministrationServer and opa) to the 'local' machine.
  ## Push "next" 3 times and then "create". The configuration utility may take a *long* time to allow you to go to the next step (you need to do one more "next" step to get to the finish).
  RESULT:
	Oracle Weblogic Server Configuration Succeeded
	New Domain com.silvermoongroup Creation Successful
	Domain Location 
	/opt/wls/domains/com.silvermoongroup
	Admin Server URL 
	http://LUNOS-DEV:7001/console
	
	
WebLogic Administrator account: lunosadmin, password: lunos123@
Node Manager Credentials : same as above
Managed Server : opa port 7003
Machines: local

install directory : $MW_HOME
	

Starting WebLogic.
  Step 1: start the Node Manager
      ## change dir to the directory of the domain that was created during the installation of WebLogic.
      cd /opt/wls/domains/com.silvermoongroup/bin
      nohup ./startNodeManager.sh > nm.out&
	  
	  ## now check the status of the node manager:
	  tail -f nm.out
	  
  Step 2: start the Administration Server
      nohup ./startWebLogic.sh > wl.out&
	  
	  ## now check the status
	  tail -f wl.out
  Step 3: visit the Admin console to make sure it works.
      open your browser and point it to:
	  htpp://localhost:7001/console
	  
  Step 4: start the "opa" server
      Two options are available here: 
	   a) you can stay in the browser and navigate to : "servers" in the "Domain Structure pane at the left hand side
	      After that go to the "control" tab (next to the "Configuration" tab under "Summary of Servers" (main pane)
		  Now select the opa server and click start
	   b) go back to the command line environment and type the following command:
	      ./startManagedWebLogic.sh opa t3://localhost:7001


CREATE IAAUSER and grant access.
================================
sqlplus SYS/password as SYSDBA @/home/koen/shared/OraclePolicyAutomation/create_IAAUSER_and_grant_statements.sql 

 



INSTALL OPA (Oracle Policy Automation)
======================================
Make sure your WebLogic servers are running before installing OPA. Only if this server is running will the installer
be able to deploy the opa applications.


/usr/local/share/opa/bin

. ./setEnv.sh

./install.sh
  action: 1. Full Install
  runtime details: 
       deployment name:  lunos_rules
	   database type: Oracle 11g or later
	   Database connection server and port: localhost:1521
	   Oracle TNS name: XE
	   Datasource user: IAAUSER
	   password: password
	   Database administration:
	      Do you want to create a new database user and tablespace?
             1. Yes, create a new tablespace and user
             2. No, I'm installing to an existing user account

          Choose an option 1-2 (default: 1): 2
		  
Admin password
==============

An password is required to configure services provided by the Hub. 
This password corresponds to the user "admin".

     admin password is: password
	 
OPA Encryption details
===================

The encryption key is used to encrypt sensitive data within the 
OPA runtime database.

IMPORTANT: You must take note of this encryption key, as you will 
be required to enter it again if you redeploy or update your 
web applications. You should keep this encryption key secure.

Hit enter to generate new encryption key.

Type 'quit'<enter> to exit this installer.

Enter the deployment encryption key: encryptionkey

Secure Session Cookie
=====================

By default OPA web applications are deployed with a secure session cookie.
  1. Leave secure session cookies on
  2. Turn off secure session cookies

Choose an option 1-2 (default: 1): 2

Weblogic Details
================

Enter the weblogic details. You should ensure that the WebLogic Admin server 
for the Domain is running and contactable.

Type 'quit'<enter> to exit this installer.


Enter the WebLogic Domain Directory: /opt/wls/domains/com.silvermoongroup
Enter the WebLogic wlst directory: /opt/wls/wls12130/wlserver/common/bin
Enter WebLogic admin URL (default: t3://localhost:7001): 
Enter WebLogic admin server name (default: AdminServer): LunosAdministrationServer
Enter the deployment target (cluster or server) on the WebLogic domain: 
  Empty target is not valid
Enter the deployment target (cluster or server) on the WebLogic domain: opa
